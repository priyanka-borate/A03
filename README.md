Directions for Using WebStorm and Git:

1. Visit https://git-scm.com/downloads and download Git, then install it on your computer.
2. Visit https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students and create a JetBrains account using your student credentials.
3. After verification, download WebStorm from the JetBrains website and install it on your computer.
4. Create a GitHub account at https://github.com/ if you haven't already.
5. Open WebStorm and create a new project by selecting "Create New Project" or "Open" if you already have a project.
6. Modify the code of your project as desired using WebStorm's integrated development environment (IDE).
7. Create a Git repository for your project by going to "VCS" in the top menu, selecting "Enable Version Control Integration," and choosing Git.
8. Commit the changes you made by selecting "VCS" in the top menu, choosing "Commit," and providing a descriptive commit message. This creates a snapshot of your changes in the local Git repository.
9. Add your project to GitHub by creating a new repository on GitHub's website.
10. Follow the instructions provided by GitHub to add an existing repository, including the URL of your local repository.
11. Create a `readme.md` file on GitHub for your project, describing its purpose, usage, and any other relevant information.
12. Go back to WebStorm and make additional changes to your project code as desired.
13. Commit and push the changes you made in WebStorm to GitHub by selecting "VCS" in the top menu, choosing "Git," and then clicking on "Push." This uploads your local changes to the remote repository on GitHub.

Directions for Using GitHub:

1. To start, log in to your GitHub account at https://github.com/.
2. Create a new repository on GitHub by clicking on the "+" icon in the top-right corner of the page and selecting "New Repository."
3. Give your repository a name and description.
4. You can add a README file to your repository by selecting the "Add a README file" checkbox.
5. Make your repository public or private, depending on your preference.
6. Select "Create repository" to create the repository.
7. From the "Code" tab in your repository, create a new branch for your changes by clicking on the branch dropdown menu and entering a branch name.
8. Edit the file(s) that you want to modify within your branch. You can make changes directly on the GitHub website or clone the repository and make changes locally using an editor of your choice.
9. Commit your changes by providing a descriptive commit message and clicking on the "Commit changes" button. This saves your changes to the branch in your repository.
10. Create a pull request to propose your changes to the original codebase. Go to the "Pull requests" tab, click on "New pull request," and select the branch with your changes as the compare branch. Include a description of the changes made.
11. After review, if your changes are approved, they can be merged into the original codebase. The repository maintainer can review the changes and click on the "Merge pull request" button.
12. Finally, delete the branch that you just merged into the main branch by going to the "Branches" tab, selecting the branch, and clicking on "Delete branch."

Glossary Definitions:

**Branch**: A separate copy of the codebase that allows developers to work on different features or changes simultaneously without affecting the main codebase.

**Clone**: To create a local copy of a repository on your machine so that you can work on it locally.

**Commit**: A snapshot of changes made to the codebase that is saved in the repository's history. Each commit includes a message describing the changes made.

**Fetch**: Retrieves changes from a remote repository and updates the local repository's references, but does not merge them with the local branch.

**Git**: A version control system that allows multiple developers to work on the same codebase and keep track of changes over time.

**GitHub**: A web-based hosting service for Git repositories that provides a platform for collaboration and code sharing.

**Merge**: Combines two or more branches or commits into a single branch.

**Merge Conflict**: When Git encounters conflicting changes between two branches or commits being merged, it presents a merge conflict that requires manual resolution.

**Push**: Uploads local changes to a remote repository.

**Pull**: Retrieves changes from a remote repository and merges them with the local branch.

**Remote**: A reference to a repository on a remote server that is used to synchronize changes between the local and remote repositories.

**Repository**: A central location where code is stored and managed. It includes the complete history of all changes made to the codebase.
